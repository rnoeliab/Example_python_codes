# Simple python examples

## Create a environment.yml
```
> conda activate py39
> conda env export --no-builds> environment.yml
```

Use this environment to run these examples:

```
a. Have Anaconda installed ([Installing Anaconda](https://github.com/rnoeliab/Installing_anaconda))
b. conda env create -f environment.yml
c. conda activate py39 
```

## Read CO2 data from CAMS-inversion
Since year 2019, CAMS has also been producing atmospheric inversions based on satellite retrievals from the
second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2, https://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/oco-2-data-center/). Only retrieval data
over land are used.
